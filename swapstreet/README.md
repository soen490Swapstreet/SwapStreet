This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Nextjs is a file system based web development framework, which means that every new folder in the app folder
will act as a new endpoint for our webpage. We can create the webpage by using a file name recognized by nextjs 
which will render the contents of the file, this file name is "page.tsx" tsx is used to create react components.

For example, by adding a folder "home" with a file "page.tsx" inside we can now navigate to the endpoint "<domain_name>/home", the contents of "home" can be edited in app/home/page.tsx

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
